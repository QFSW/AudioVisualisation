Audio Visualisation Addon

Welcome everyone, this is a Blender addon I am working on to help with creating Audio Visualisations.
It will take your settings on how you want the visualisation to look, as well as how big each frequency gap should be etc. and it will automatically go through and bake all the animations for you

It is still heavily a WIP, as despite it being fully functional there are a vareity of features I wish to add

I hope you enjoy it and any feedback is appreciated
